## Description
I started playing this CTF and thought I couldn't complete it, but still tried my best. The url given was [https://07.levelupctf.com/radio](https://07.levelupctf.com/radio) and description says we are an **Agent** in top-secret operation: Hack Another Day. The CTF had 7 flags in total. The last flag would defeat **The Matriarch** and we would win.

### Flag 1
Visiting the url, the browser gets redirected to `/login`. After trying basic SQLi payloads and default credentials, I start to look at JS files for the potential attack vector. I use my custom made tool *JScanner* to extract sensitive info and i get `FLAG{504e8256b8a208845fe18a77e7b304b7}` in comment as well as new url.

### Flag 2
I downloaded an apk from that url. Since I never did apk decompiling and static code analysis it was going to be hard. For some reason, I don't like java, still, somehow I had the mindset to complete the CTF. Using apktool I decompiled the apk file. 
```
root@kali-linux:~/tmp/CTF/Bugcrowd0x07/apks# apktool d communications.apk 
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true
I: Using Apktool 2.4.1-dirty on communications.apk
I: Loading resource table...
I: Decoding AndroidManifest.xml with resources...
I: Loading resource table from file: /root/.local/share/apktool/framework/1.apk
I: Regular manifest package...
I: Decoding file-resources...
I: Decoding values */* XMLs...
I: Baksmaling classes.dex...
I: Copying assets and libs...
I: Copying unknown files...
I: Copying original files...
```

Looking through the files, I was overwhelmed as it was lot of files, and all I was getting was unreadable **.smali** files. Again, googling for a bit showed me another tool that does decompile very well. I used [Online Java Decompiler](http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk) and got nice looking .java files. I got the second flag `FLAG{a445c73c8cb97421d1923a8c51c221fd}` by doing `grep -ir "FLAG"`. I was tired then and went to sleep.

### Flag 3
Third flag was difficult to find. I did dynamic analysis but it errored out when using the app. Going through all **.java** files, **MainActivity.java** was interesting. I found two different endpoints `/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e/8cd98f00b204e9800998/forgotpassword` and `/fa694c73da13c94e49cc82b/06a28bdb78b6c02e16862a3/chat` from two different functions.

![Apk Code](/posts/writeups/assets/images/bugcrowd0x07_apk_code.png)

Going to forgot password endpoint, I can enumerate users from its error message, and chat endpoint was forbidden to access as I wasn't authorized. Looking at the source code again, there is some sort of authentication mechanism by using the header `3NCRYPT3D-CH4T`.So, I looked more and more into java files and finally found its key through grep.
```
root@kali-linux:~/tmp/CTF/Bugcrowd0x07/source/source_code# rgrep "ENCRYPTED" -i
sources/com/example/levelup/MainActivity.java:    public void encryptedChat() {
sources/com/example/levelup/MainActivity.java:        String key = getApplicationContext().getString(R.string.encrypted_chat_key);
sources/com/example/levelup/C0262R.java:        public static final int encrypted_chat_key = 2131492892;
sources/com/example/helloworld/R.java:        public static final int encrypted_chat_key = 2131492892;
Binary file resources/classes.dex matches
resources/res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="encrypted_chat_key">8b0955d2682eb74347b9e71ea0558c67</string>
resources/res/values/public.xml:    <public type="string" name="encrypted_chat_key" id="2131492892" />
```
<br>
Having a header and key, I visited the url and got a chat that looks obfuscated. Hmm, nice giraffe.

![Encrypted Chat](/posts/writeups/assets/images/bugcrowd0x07_encrypted_chat.png)

We get the flag `FLAG{e8606532b027bfd324ea31d1b4f116c2}` and geolocation data **37°43'58.5"N 122°30'08.5"W** by looking at the exif metadata of giraffe picture.

### Flag 4
My intuition says that either its `ROT13` or `ROT47` and it turned out to be ciphertext of ROT13.
After, decrypting, we get this: 
```
agent_nova: meow
agent_5a247455: MESSAGE_DELETED
agent_521bcd5: Have you got word on our new mission yet
agent_5a247455: yeah we do, check the "mission list". they caught some HACK Agent as well
agent_521bcd5: thats crazy, anyways check out this dope giraffe I saw at the zoo the other day
agent_5a247455: hahahaha that's awesome
```
<br>
Nothing interesting except those usernames. I tried using all those usernames in forgot password endpoint and only two of them exist. To reset their password, a secret question has to be answered. They were:  
**1) What's the name of your favorite animal lion at the zoo?**   
**2) What's your favorite hobby?**  
I was stuck at this point and looking at discussion in discord and talking with some friends, I got a hint to OSINT by geolocation. I used google maps for this purpose and got a zoo name **San Francisco Zoo**. 

![Googlemap OSINT](/posts/writeups/assets/images/bugcrowd0x07_googlemaps_osint.png)

Searching for their twitter page, website, and other social media, I got nothing. I was trying to brute-force lion names. After spending a lot of hours on OSINT, I simply decided to search SF Zoo Lion name and got an answer Jahari. I logged in using the password the reset page provided and got a dashboard with a target list. However, there was no flag. At the start, I said that `/radio` endpoint caused redirection to `/login` probably due to the fact we weren't logged in. Visiting the endpoint `/radio` gives me a flag as well as a message that there is something hidden inside agent images.

![Radio Endpoint](/posts/writeups/assets/images/bugcrowd0x07_radio_endpoint.png)

The exfiltration of data through ping is useless. However, i got the password **pwn4llthebugz** as well as flag `FLAG{f0dee25f617e2cb820b9b44fcdf90ed8}`

### Flag 5
There were 9 images and I tried different steganography techniques and tools. Manually viewing the image shows random numbers inside of pics. I got 3 random numbers: 1337,2099,921. One of my friends showed through changing image temperature that there is another number 415 inside one image. 

![Temperature Changed](/posts/writeups/assets/images/bugcrowd0x07_color_temperature.png)

I wonder what's the use of those numbers. Also, binwalk showed that some data are embedded inside it.

![Binwalk Image](/posts/writeups/assets/images/bugcrowd0x07_binwalk.png)

Trying to extract all data from `binwalk`, recursively for all files with more data embedded inside them, it was a tough job. However, there was nothing and I wasted my precious 1-2 hours. Soon, I tried brute-forcing as images were in format *agent1.jpg*,*agent2.jpg*,... I found out there was a picture called *agent87.jpg*. Using `Steghide` with password pwn4llthebugz extracted a file called console.txt with the following data in it.
```
root@kali-linux:~/tmp/CTF/Bugcrowd0x07/targets/other_agents# cat console.txt 
Dear agent_521bcd5,

As ordered by Matriarch, I have created a backdoor console that will allow us to launch WannaSpy when time is right.

We're not worried about anyone getting in since they have to go through many doors to actually get in.

Once you are ready, you will find that the console lives on 3389.

FLAG{f0dee25f617e2cb820b9b44fcdf90ed8}

Regards
agent_1337
```
<br>
Here's our dear flag `FLAG{f0dee25f617e2cb820b9b44fcdf90ed8}`.

### Flag 6
It was insanely difficult to get this flag. Nmap shows port 3389 as closed. Now, I was stuck. Again, going to the official bugcrowd discord server, I found that we have to do port knocking. The random numbers were port numbers, all of them were closed. For those who don't know what port knocking is:    
<br>
`"In computer networking, port knocking is a method of externally opening ports on a firewall by generating a connection attempt on a set of prespecified closed ports. Once a correct sequence of connection attempts is received, the firewall rules are dynamically modified to allow the host which sent the connection attempts to connect over specific port(s)"`  
<br>
I soon developed a python3 script that automates this job using itertools. I initially used **knock** for port knocking but it didn't work. That was frustrating, soon I used nc for port knocking, and that didn't work too. That was more frustating. Finally, I used Nmap and the script looked something like this
```python
from itertools import permutations 
import os

ports = [1337,415,2099,921,3389]
permutations_object = permutations(ports)
permutations_list = list(permutations_object)

def port_knock():
    try:
        for x in range(0,120):
            print(permutations_list[x])
            os.system('nmap -p {},{},{},{},{} 07.levelupctf.com'.format(permutations_list[x][0], permutations_list[x][1], permutations_list[x][2],permutations_list[x][3], permutations_list[x][4]))
    except Exception as E:
	print(E)
port_knock()
```
<br>
The script worked fine and it opened the port. Yay! I initially mistook that port for **RDP** and tried to connect through tools using RDP protocol but it didn't work. Later, I visited in the browser and it worked like charm. However, there was no console. *Sad emoji*. Dirbusting a bit got me `/console` endpoint which had a python3 interactive interpreter. It was **Werkzeug debug console**.

![Werkzeug console](/posts/writeups/assets/images/bugcrowd0x07_werkzeug.png)
  
I looked at source code, js files, and URLs. There was a secret variable exposed in the javascript file but I couldn't use it. Doing **searchsploit** showed me Werkzeug console had an exploit. The Metasploit exploit didn't work for some reason so I opted for a custom exploit. I got a shell after using that exploit and got another flag `FLAG{022d8a7a561a02c371fd7c5ec3e5ea06}`

### Flag 7
Flag 7 was very easy. There were credentials in `/opt` and I logged in using that credentials. There was a button to destroy the WannaSpy spyware and I did it. I defeated *The Matriarch* and got 7th flag which was embedded in the picture...

### Overall
The challenge was fun and I never thought I could complete that challenge still I tried. The endorphin rush from completing the CTF was greater than morphine high... My friends Naina, Atik-Rahman, and others helped me in this CTF. Overall, Bugcrowd did an awesome job in developing the CTF. I submitted a writeup of the challenge near 12 pm. I stood 9th and got ** 3-month pentesterlab subscription** and **bugcrowd tshirt**.
